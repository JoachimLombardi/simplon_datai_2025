"1","negative","Vineet, what you are trying to do is a terrible idea! If you ever find yourself having to engineer something as fundamental as that, take a step back and work out what else does it! I don't really believe in the whole spoon fed SO thing, but what mtwebster says is on the right track!"
"2","positive","'Course I do, corrected."
"3","positive","Excellent, happy to help! If you don't mind, can you accept my answer?"
"4","negative","@talnicolas I'm using it a few dozen times in my class. It's heavy to write, not easy to read and very painful to debug. I'm sorry, I didn't think the question was that subjective, maybe someone should move it to PROGRAMMERS!?"
"5","neutral","I didn't select an answer because even though two of them helped neither of them is complete."
"6","neutral","This is for Tomcat 5.5"
"7","neutral","Paraphrasing Cypher, StateOf.Confusion is bliss, so... Do all `MapCollection Items` have the same state? If so then have a single `ItemStatus` that every `Item` references. [`Application.Properties`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.application.properties%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) may be a way to globally communicate visualness."
"8","positive","Excellent! Thank you for your perseverence :)"
"9","positive","Wow, I've just had a look at the Corona SDK. It looks excellent! A really intuitive way to build apps. Thanks for the tip!"
"10","neutral","A few but they all seem proprietary."
"11","negative","To push it to Heroku, you'll have to add it to your repo. Why don't you want to commit it? It's recommended to commit Gemfile.lock in your repo (unless you're developing a gem): When developing an app, check in your Gemfile.lock, since you will use the bundler tool across all machines, and the precision enforced by bundler is extremely desirable for applications."
"12","positive","@Thorbjï¿½rn Ravn Andersen that's really great!"
"13","neutral","I'm not sure if this is a case here but if you are really worried about the gc in this case and you'd like to better control behavior of your derived maps and thus their influence on the performance of the gc in my opinion you should take a look at the usage of different kind of references (strong, weak, soft, phantom) in java.Also remember that pre-optimization is a root of all evil especially in programming."
"14","negative","I don't see how this is possible, but I really, really hate to run my query an extra time just to get the record count so I can build a pager. When I say a pager I simply mean the common gizmo with a link for each 10 records for example."
"15","neutral","Have added an answer"
"16","negative","Yes, but it's tricky, since datetime parsing in SQL is a pain in the neck."
"17","negative","@njahnke: to me, it does not matter what they advise if they do not provide alternatives. I have been a happy user of qthttp thus far without worries, but yes, it is just a quick workaround as written."
"18","negative","@MaximilianB_ther I'm sorry to hear that... Maybe you can get in touch with the developers of BaronReplays and ask them to help you out? If not, I'm afraid I cannot help you much more! Regards, Rodit"
"19","neutral","This question would now be more appropriate on SuperUser."
"20","negative","After looking at the answers below, I am very sad that this is an example of backwards progress for SSRS."
"21","negative","I installed Delphi 2009 Update 4 yesterday (very painful process ) Now, How can I make sure if it is properly updated? What is the build number shown in the IDE about box?"
"22","negative","I'm very sorry about my horrible English! only for this example I use radio button, I'm considering using textbox too"
"23","neutral","I assume you're using Ken Reitz's excellent requests library to do the HTTP requests (if not, you really should be!)Most likely, the problem is that requests doesn't add a 'Content-type' header to multi-part uploads, and packmgr doesn't read multi-part bodies with no 'Content-type' header. So, while a normal 'requests' POST of a multipart-encoded file would go something like this: you instead have to use the longer form, setting an explicit content-type: Note that one side-effect of doing it this way is that it cannot stream the file - the entire package ZIP file will be read into memory."
"24","negative","Not for me, but I can suggest some possibilities :It may cause problem while editing--> This can be solved by using some comments--> And then this will cause the code messier Some code may crash and your code success will go away from you |.|--> No solution - unless you know more about the code! Code upgrade problem-- If external code has upgrade you may have problem to know which is that code--> Again use comments--> And again messier So these are some that I can think about!EDIT---Some cons:You can make it more convenient to edit--> You can edit more than one code at onceYou can edit some code that you wan't able to edit (external resource before)--> Modifying is more convenient.You can make it load faster--> 1 file with 1000 KB is faster than 1000 files with 1 KB each.It is safer--> You don't need to worry about external resource being deleted!!These are my suggestions. Try to think more about it!"
"25","negative","I have just finish that site, but there is a silly bug that remain... if you check tu horizontal position of the WHOLE page there is a slight shift... nothing to cry about but WHY here is the 2 pages any idea, the horizontal css is: i dont like my page to do the cha-cha-cha !"
"26","neutral","So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one. I think the example below solved the problem (or at least gives an idea of how to solve it): The extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped."
"27","negative","Lastly, I don't see any styling data. Does your project have some CSS defined somewhere?"
"28","negative","I'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly: do you know why? I guess it has to do with escaping, but what and where?"
"29","positive","Here's a secret. In the chrome dev tools, do a cpu profile run. After you have stopped capturing, at the bottom of the screen is a down triangle next to Heavy (Bottom Up). Click the triangle and select Flame Chart. Once you are in Flame Chart mode, you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles, how long they take, and exactly what functions are being called. The Flame Chart is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues, ng-repeat performance problems, digest cycle problems! I really don't know how I was able to debug and profile before the Flame Chart. Here is an example:"
"30","negative","And what do those lines upon lines of errors say? (Sheesh! Getting information out of you is about as painful as pulling out teeth!!)"
"31","neutral","The function signature for pthread_create requires a function that returns . Also, returned from should be treated opaquely. Both of these changes are reflected below and compile on my machine: UPDATE: There are some other issues with your program as well. For example, it's very likely that main will exit before your thread runs. You should join on your thread if you want to make sure it exits first. Using raw pthreads is a great way to learn about threads but can be very very painful compared to some of the pre-existing frameworks out there - try boost::thread or std::thread if you want to just get up and running with as little hassle as possible."
"32","positive","Excellent! Thanks for the info."
"33","negative","this is for facial recognition, and auto submitting username and passwords in your browser, if you are in front of your PC. nothing malicious bout that ?!?"
"34","negative","Here is my PHP code.. ..I'm extremely crappy with my JavaScript code, could someone help me convert this? I basically want to convert a variable such as marine-heavy to Marine (heavy)."
"35","neutral","No, the output is not the same; one is a Unicode value, the other an undecoded bytes value.For ASCII, that looks the same, but when you load any web page that uses characters outside the ASCII characterset, the difference will be much clearer.Take UTF-8 encoded data, for example: That's a simple U+2013 EN DASH character. The bytes representation shows the 3 bytes UTF-8 uses to encode the codepoint.You really want to read up on Unicode vs. encoded data here, I recommend:The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!) by Joel SpolskyThe Python Unicode HOWTOPragmatic Unicode by Ned Batchelder"
"36","positive","Wow, great! thanks, I didn't know this one existed."
"37","negative","Suppose I have this interface And this class Is there a way, or is there a tool that can let me automatically put in the comments of each member in a base class or interface? Because I hate re-writing the same comments for each derived sub-class!"
"38","negative","I asked before about pixel-pushing, and have now managed to get far enough to get noise to show up on the screen. Here's how I init: Here's how I render each frame: Problem is this is awfully awfully slow, around 5fps. I think my path to publish the buffer must be wrong. Is it even possible to do full-screen pixel-based graphics that I could update at 30fps, without using the 3D chip?"
"39","positive","Paradise, if you submit that as a separate response I'll make you the winner!"
"40","negative","Now when I load it to the device, an image won't show up. This is all kinds of horrible!"
"41","negative","It's very painful to add multiple tickets to Trac or to have it as your own todo list. That causes people to use their own task management tools so tasks are then spread all around. Is there any plugin or macro that would quicken the process of adding a ticket?"
"42","positive","Excellent! Look forward to hearing from you."
"43","neutral","Okay, I see your confusion and edited my response with some sample code/an appropriate link to wikipedia. You are confusing the entropy of the model's probability distribution with the cross entropy (or likelihood) of the predictions it makes on real data. Consider a model that assigns probability 1 to some event and probability 0 to everything else. It has 0 entropy, but makes absolutely terrible predictions on any testing distribution that isn't a purely non-random sequence, assigning 0 probability to events that actually happen."
"44","negative","Was afraid someone would say that...! Is there any hack I could put in place?"
"45","positive","Excellent questions! This particular project will need DS, WAYF, etc."
"46","negative","That's really bad. GWT looks extremely ugly with IE8 default!"
"47","positive","Excellent point! :)"
"48","neutral","When you try it, you get the error: This comes from (line 3023 on my sources, but varies by version), in . The comment there explains that: This routine is to be called by statements that must not run inside a transaction block, typically because they have non-rollback-able side effects or do internal commits.For it's called from in under the case for , but unfortunately there isn't any informative comment that says why specifically isn't safe to run in a transaction.Looking at the sources, I can see that for one thing it forces a checkpoint.Overall, though, I don't see anything that really screams out we can't do this transactionally. It's more we haven't implemented the functionality to do this transactionally."
"49","neutral","@KubaOber, I was in the process of revising the answer, but see you've already answered it."
"50","positive","Let's imagine something like this: Later I can do something like this: Is there any way I can set the limit when using the named query, and not when defining it? I'd would really love to do something like: or Thx in advance! :-)"
"51","neutral","This can probably be done using JavaScript."
"52","neutral","If I understand your question correctly, the exception is because variable is not found inside the function. I'd suggest learning scoping rules in Python or read this excellent to-the-point chapter on the topic (or search for this topic on the Web!).The other thing I'd recommend is not to handle all exceptions as you've shown in your snippet. Here's why.The fixed code could look something like this:"
"53","neutral","You'll need to create or call a refresh function from the same place as the alert() in the .get() call. That function is a success post-back."
"54","positive","As I comment your question, there are of problems inside your code so better will be to use some ready function/class for it :) just search for it ..How ever I can give you easy way to display what you want..Replace your FOR loop with that code and it will be fine :) But really !!! 1st - MYSQL_ functions are deprecated use mysqli or PDO instead.. 2nd - ESCAPE all variables in your queries.. 3rd - Think for using more flexible methods of work (function/objects ..)"
"55","neutral","You can download a local copy of jQuery or use a CDN. This link has details: http://jquery.com/download/"
"56","neutral","I think it speaks volumes about IE that the keyCodes for the arrow keys form an angry sad face: %&'( (works better in the comment text entry font)"
"57","neutral","I'm using Apache's implementation, namely http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/"
"58","negative","Okay, a before <example> And a desired after <example> I know, horrific (don't ask!) See how the slash in the key indicates children, and how the order is nested accordingly? And items without orders are simply shifted to the bottom. But also how multiple 'same level' items with the same order are merely sorted by key?"
"59","neutral","I need the page to include the sitemap because I'm saving context from each of the three previous pages. That way the user can click the previous page in the sitemap, and it will load the data I stored (i.e. load the data from their previous search)."
"60","positive","There is another way... As the WPF application is coded with the .NET framework, it is compiled to MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language). This means you can use a decompiler such as ILSpy to decompile and view the code of BaronReplays. This will give you some idea of how BaronReplays works so you can implement the same ideas into your own code project...Hope this helped!Rodit"
"61","positive","Would you happen to have another column in your table where you can group them as 1 2 3 4 , 1 2 3 4, etc?It would look something like this:1st column | second columnA | 1B | 1C | 1D | 1A | 2B | 2C | 2D | 2If you order it by 2nd column, it will return 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2. But since you have another column, you can do order by 1st column, 2nd column, and it will be 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2.This ia ofcourse assuming that you have a field like 1st column. But given that you're looking at having them order like 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4, there must be something in your other fields that can help you achieved that Hope this helps!"
"62","positive","You would need to create a counter integer variable that can keep track of the line index for you. Hope it helps!"
"63","neutral","Yes, this is question."
"64","negative","Everytime I execute my app in debug mode, the execution breaks inside some class file of an external library that I'm using. Even though it's a NullPointerException, for some reason I can hit resume and continue the execution. In case you're curious, I've put the stacktrace below. My problem though is that I simply want to stop that. It's extremely annoying and happens every now and then during the execution. But I can't find any setting anywhere which will prevent breaking inside class files. How do I avoid this?"
"65","negative","I cannot seem to figure out why the phpunit target does not output any test results even though I have tests in position. The problem I am finding is there is no indication as to what the problem is! Incredibly frustrating. The output is as follows: My build.xml is as follows: My system: Vista, PHP 5.2.9, PHPUnit 3.4, PHPUnderControl, CruiseControl"
"66","positive","excellent alternative!"
"67","negative","I don't have any control over the dataset I recieve. The only thing I know is that it contains everything."
"68","neutral","Is your test case exhibiting this behavior in jsfiddle? I have tried it in Firefox, Chrome and Safari and do not see the shrinking you're talking about, although Chrome and Safari force a left-margin indent while dragging. (???) &#xA;&#xA;"
"69","positive","You're very welcome ! It would be nice though if you upvoted and accepted the answer. This way other users could refer to it if they pass to the same trouble you had =P"
"70","positive","@SamDeHaan, you are correct! transposed them as i was writing."
"71","negative","Is this valid ? what I'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time?"
"72","negative","I'm afraid you cannot fetch that!The Graph API don't provide any API to do so."
"73","negative","I store ranges in MySQL DB, but a lot of queries to MySQL for getting provider name - it's terrible :("
"74","neutral","Make a canvas path glow by applying a series of overlapping shadows with increasing blurA Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/m1erickson/Z3Lx2/You can change the styling of the glow by varying the number of overlays and the blur size.Example code for a glow effect: To get the outline path of your phone image, you can use the marching ants algorithm.This algorithm will create a path that outlines an image. In your case you would define the image as all pixels that are not transparent.Here's a very good implementation of marching ants that is used in the excellent d3 library:https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/blob/master/geom/contour/contour.jsIt's used like this:DrawImage your phone on the canvas. Get the pixel color array from the canvas using ctx.getImageData Define a function that checks the pixel array for non-transparent pixels at any x,y on the canvas. Call the contour function: Here's an example result:the glow is automatically generated using overlapping shadowsthe outline path of the phone is calculated using the marching ants algorithm"
"75","positive","It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program's design more precise.Next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as . After having done this you can use .Here's how: Be warned that it's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs, but this option won't hurt much if you're just trying to disable a function. By the way, this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it, it's now up to you to choose which method will receive this. Hope this was helpful!"
"76","negative","I want to duplicate a very large table, but I do not want to copy it row by row. Is there a way to duplicate it? For example, you can TRUNCATE w/o deleting row/row, so i was wondering if there is something similar for copying entire tables UPDATE: row by row insert is very painful (because of 120M rows). Anyway to avoid that?"
"77","negative","Yeah, I know, I just can't figure out where the 'private' is coming from. It's very frustrating!"
"78","positive","Excellent! PHP really is an impressive language."
"79","positive","If you only need the count (like you express in your original question), you could do: Hope it helps!"
"80","positive","There are two issues with your regex pattern: Firstly, you forgot to add the ^ at the beginning. this is why only the last characters were checked, or to say: you did not check the entire input. Secondly, your cyrill check did not seem to be correct. Still, I am not used to cyrillic letters and I should be careful before I judge ;) hope it helps!"
"81","positive","Cool, that was going to be my next suggestion! Good luck :)"
"82","negative","no answer yet.... sad =("
"83","positive","You can use this Hope this helps!"
"84","negative","yeaa im just not sure how i would be able to store a user input string into the array. I've looked around online and tried out some of their code. So im not sure. I really hate mips. :("
"85","positive","that's great :)"
"86","neutral","Some of your code seemed redundant, so I removed some. Such as defining and then duplicating it into so I just defined once. I got rid of , , and since you can just as easily enter the value directly.Then I got rid of the whole get the latest file in the log folder, and just added the content to the log file defined earlier. I changed the log entries so they were done by tabs so the entry type, date, and the actual entry all line up nicely when you view the log file.Lastly I changed the whole If>ElseIf>ElseIf thing into a Switch, because Switch is awesome and totally underused! Oh yeah, I got rid of because it's pointless to define a variable and then just echo it. What you could do is in the section have it write-host the error and call the log function again, so people are forced to enter a valid entry."
"87","negative","@Pekka - what's the emoticon for being terribly embarrassed!"
"88","neutral","[fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/mcoomey/JPC4J/1/) was not related to the table layout of auto versus fixed. The fiddle shows that it works for both. If you are still seeing a problem while using the newer version of jQuery-ui, then it must be another issue with your code."
"89","negative","I have implemented this in my Visual Studio addon Visual Installer as IntelliSense Member Completion.If you type variable followed by a period (.) a list of all possible members of this class is presented in a list from which you can choose:Second option is to move cursor over any class to view it's members:See details here: http://www.unsigned-softworks.sk/visual-installer/features.html#member-completionP.S. sorry for this self promo - TLama is very angry for promoting 3rd party software in Inno questions but there is no support for this in official Inno Setup editor and many people ask for this."
"90","positive","How do you train Neural Network for pattern recognition? For example a face recognition in a picture how would you define the output neurons? (eg. how to detect where is the face exactly, rather than just saying that there is a face in camera). Also, how about detecting multiple faces and different size of faces? If anyone could give me a pointer it would be really great Cheers!"
"91","positive","the question just came to me from a different team. The question was how to query the users in the exchange server's particular User group. Its said that the Exchange server user group is not linked to an Ad group. The examples i could get are all for querying based on AD group. I heard there are two ways either through SQL or through DirectoryServices. Either solution is fine, but through DirectoryServices will be super awesome! Thanks again!"
"92","neutral","What will you be doing with the images? Displaying them in the browser?"
"93","negative","It is really painfull to get all code form TFS whenever you make a build using NANT. Is there any settings in ccnet.config which will only take the files which are changed form last time which can speed up the process."
"94","negative","I'm not for sure how the ControlCollection of ASP.Net works, so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me. I recently discovered the magic that is extension methods and Linq. Well, I was very sad to find that this isn't valid syntax However from what I can tell, does implement the interface which provides such methods, so what gives? Why doesn't that just work? I have found a decent work around for this issue at least:"
"95","positive","@Bober02 if u are in this industry sooner or later you will meet Martin Thompson's excellent blog, I'm glad to introduce you to it. :) http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/07/memory-barriersfences.html Happy reading!"
"96","negative","we definitely have differing views on what is the easier method achieve this functionality, and dealing with threads is not easier for me"
"97","positive","Is there a shorthand for a new line character in Scala? In Java (on Windows) I usually just use \\n, but that doesn't seem to work in Scala - specifically outputs in Eclipse, (sic) from the command line, and from the REPL (GREAT SUCCESS!) works, but is there anything shorter?"
"98","positive","I have a long scrolling page, and want to test if an element is 100px from the top, then apply a class elsewhere (until the next element in line is 100px from the top) If I could just get the basic statement I would be ecstatic, anything extra would be a bonus!"
"99","positive","@Gabriele No worries! Glad to have helped :)"
"100","positive","Excellent point! Thanks!! I did mean just the left side though.. (I should have specified that). Was glad to learn your insight though.."
"101","positive","You can do as followed:When your app is not started/ running and you start from an notification, onCreate gets called. When your app is running (background or foreground), and you start a new intent from an notification this method gets called: (if you are using singleTop) To detect whether your app is running back- or foreground, you can simply set a boolean in onPause/onResume: Hope it helps!"
"102","negative","I just caught that, Firefox doesn't preform spell checking on the title field for some reason."
"103","positive","is in so u need not to worry!Internally the data is always stored as TEXT, so even if you create table with , SQLite is going to follow the rules of data type"
"104","negative","I'm trying to output the following from within a liquid template: Obviously, Liquid sees this as a variable named and tries to do substitution. I'm trying to find out how I can output the actual braces. So far, I've found one method that works, but it's incredibly ugly: Yeah, told you it was gross. Here are other things I've tried: Any advice here?"
"105","neutral","Assets are bundled with your APK and they are read only. You cannot delete them in your app.If you're really worried about storage usage, consider alternative database distribution mechanisms such as downloading it over the network."
"106","negative","exactly why i'm asking because thats what i fear!"
"107","positive","<3 <3 <3 ! ! ! :)"
"108","negative","I need to perform the same hash server side. All this code that I am digging through seems to have been run through some compression tool. Devastating."
"109","neutral","Just that they make you list the type twice. i.e. List list = new ArrayList()"
"110","negative","I'm looking for as automatic way as possible. Surronding every query with a StopWatch would work, but it's a lot of work."
"111","neutral","You need to make the following changes to your code: However keep in mind that this is extremely vulnerable to SQL injection, and you should also swap MySQL for PDO/MySQLi immediately if you plan to use this code on a live website."
"112","neutral","I just noticed also that you're calling **sortable** on the reportTableBody class, but that class does not exist in the fiddle code."
"113","positive","I have but instead of bothering them I'd like to do it myself. I really enjoy trying new things and so far figuring all of this out has been very fun!"
"114","negative","You are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input. You should either read the entire line (including the newline, perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.P.S. Converting case by adding or subtracting 32 is a really awful approach. It won't work with anything but a-z and A-Z (in the English alphabet). It won't work for most characters outside the Basic Latin block and shouldn't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case (such as newline). You should be using and instead."
"115","positive","Is there a way to pattern match in F# so that it will check to see if both elements in a two element tuples are equal. I'm incredibly new to F#, and also new to the whole concept of Pattern Matching in general. I was thinking something along the lines of... But I guess that would be too easy hah. Any suggestions? Or is there even a way to do that? Thanks for your help, you guys are incredibly helpful!"
"116","negative","Unless you are able to demonstrate the problem with displayed code then I'm afraid there's not much more I can do to help you out."
"117","neutral","Nope. It comes right up."
"118","positive","Gosh ! you're right !!! Excellent !!!! Is there a way to expand it programatically ? I added .setOngoing(true) (to the top) but it's not expanded... (not really the top because the first one is a notification when I'm plugged to USB for tools developpement ). Thank you again my friend !"
"119","negative","@Colin Pickard: That's really sad :'( :'( :'("
"120","neutral","The first line sets the file name variables and sets the field separator to comma. The second line sets the output field separator to comma too. The third line prints lines with 3 fields to the new file; the fourth line prints lines with other than 3 fields to the error file.Note that your code would be excruciatingly slow on big files because it executes two processes per line. This code has only one process operating on the whole file which will be really important if the input grow to thousand or millions or more lines."
"121","positive","Excellent! Thanks."
"122","negative","Sorry, I was just trying to help and obviously misread the question. No need to get angry!"
"123","positive","Great! Good to hear it. Can you please accept my answer? :)"
"124","positive","You are right. See my update! Make a suggestion pls and I'll catch your thoughts ;)"
"125","negative","I have a function name called setValue, used in many classes. Also, i have a global function by the same name. When i press C-], it goes to arbitrary setValue function. How do i directly jump to the global setValue function? It is really pain to use tnext every time to find if the function global."
"126","neutral","Also, your fiddle example seems to be cut from a much bigger project with a lot of superfluous code hanging around. I think if you are able to duplicate the issue in fiddle then you should pare down the code to eliminate some of that and make it easier to troubleshoot."
"127","neutral","jQuery abuse! Use CSS: HTML: FiddleThis should be much faster then jQuery (as with everything CSS)."
"128","positive","that's the hope :)"
"129","positive","@AlexK. excellent thought. Edited."
"130","positive","This works excellent, thank you very much! (Trim('0'||mycolumns))"
"131","negative","Don't have access to any other versions here I'm afraid :("
"132","neutral","I was wondering whether anyone knows of any tools available that perform the task of analyzing one or more CSS files, determining the similarity between the various rules within the files and presenting the user with options for the merging and reduction of rulesets. I ask this because a project I am working on has reached the point where it has so much CSS that Internet Explorer (Still the bottom line I'm afraid) chokes on the CSS after page load, causing a 3-5 second lock-up in interactivity until the choke is processed. In case you're wondering: Yes, I am sure it is the CSS causing this issue."
"133","neutral","No problem. I see you got your answer above. Did that satisfy your question or is there anything else?"
"134","neutral","Added bounty to see if I can get a full answer (ideally: the code snippet that, when added above, answers the question)."
"135","positive","That's excellent! Please post it as an answer so I can accept it."

Worse, it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text, which depends on the width of the div and the font-size, and probably requires JS to compute.Anyway, after all the above disclaimers, here's the hack: Use two divs with the same text, one on top of the other. One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width. Again, you'll probably need JS in order to compute the number of lines in the div.

To do that, it looks up all the information it needs for an invocation from the object itself at run time.By contrast, your C++ code is probably early-bound, which means offsets into the COM object's vtable are compiled directly into your code.

You would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files (e.g. quick-and-dirty PHP replacement), and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other Ruby script. It is more common to use ERB simply because it is more flexible, but I'll admit that I have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute files for quick little utility websites."

By this I mean the overwhelming list of deferred issues, 99% complete code and oversights that accumulate towards the end of the project. This normally causes a lot of stress and compromises in order to meet the deadline. If a development organisation has never experienced project crunch, it would be a big surprise to me. Therefore I think this is a neat way of locking into a some shared pain and suggesting agile techniques as a load-levelling technique should provoke some interest that can lead onto a more complete discussion of the methodology(s)."
